## Make Evolutions Easier

In addition to lowering level evolutions, this setting also affects the following Pokemon:

**Always changed:**

* Inkay's evolution no longer requires that the console be held upside down.

**Only in Sun/Moon:**

* All Pokemon that normally evolve by levelling up in Vast Poni Canyon also evolve at level 35, in addition to their regular evolution method. This affects Magneton, Nosepass and Charjabug.
* Crabrawler also evolves at level 35, in addition to its regular evolution method.

**Only in Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon:**

* Normally, base form Rockruff evolves into Lycanroc-Midday or Lycanroc-Midnight (depending on the game), and Rockruff-OwnTempo evolves into Lycanroc-Dusk. This setting allows any Rockruff to evolve into any Lycanroc form, though game restrictions remain unless "remove impossible evolutions" is enabled.

**Only if Wild Pokemon are randomized:**

* Pokemon that evolve by having another specific Pokemon in the party now evolve at level 35 instead. This affects Mantyke, and if "Change Impossible Evolutions" is used, Shelmet and Karrablast.

## Remove Time-Based Evolutions

## "Follow Evolutions" Settings

For "Follow Evolutions" settings, traits will normally follow evolutions, but there are a few exceptional cases:

* For split evolutions (one Pokemon having several different evolutions), most traits will not follow to any of the evolutions. The reason for this is to make sure that the different evolutions are sufficiently different, while also preventing one evolution from being the "correct" one. The only exceptions to this are TM/HM compatibility and move tutor compatibility, which *will* follow all branches of the split evolution.
* For converging evolutions (several Pokemon evolving into one Pokemon), traits will follow for **one** of the evolution chains. When randomizing evolutions, converging evolutions are avoided as much as possible, but they may occur sometimes.


## Estimate Evolution Level

For any evolution that is **not** a level-up evolution, an evolution level is **estimated** from all level-up evolutions in the loaded ROM via the following algorithm.

### Definitions

For a given level-up evolution **"X → Y"** at level `lvl_XY`,
where **X** has a Base Stat Total (BST) `X_bst` and **Y** has a BST `Y_bst`,
the **level-up triplet** of this evolution is defined as:

```
(X_bst, Y_bst, lvl_XY)
```

For example, in Generation 1, the level-up triplet for **"Bulbasaur → Ivysaur"** would be:

```
(253, 325, 16)
```

The set of all level-up triplets for all level-up evolutions is called `samples`.

For a **non-level-up** evolution, where the BST before the evolution is `targetPreBST` and the BST after the evolution is `targetPostBST`,
an evolution level is estimated as follows:

---

### Initialization

```java
double p = 1;                  // distance weighting exponent: 1/d^p
double preFactor = 1.5;        // scaling factor for pre-evolution BST difference
double postFactor = 3;         // scaling factor for post-evolution BST difference
double largeWeightForZero = 1; // weight to use if distance is zero
```

Furthermore, let `weightedSum = 0` and `weightSum = 0`.

---

### Algorithm

For each level-up triplet `(samplePre, samplePost, sampleLevel)` in `samples`:

1. **Compute the euclidian distance** between the sample’s `(samplePre, samplePost)` pair and the target’s `(targetPreBST, targetPostBST)` pair.
   The smaller this distance, the more similar the evolution is to the target.
   ```java
   double dx = targetPreBST - samplePre;
   double dy = targetPostBST - samplePost;
   double dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
 
2. **Assign a weight** to the sample.

    * If the distance is zero, use `largeWeightForZero`.
    * Otherwise, use `1 / (distance ^ p)` so that closer samples have higher weight.

3. **Compute scaling factors** `scaledPre` and `scaledPost` for how the target’s BSTs compare to the sample’s BSTs.

    * The `preFactor` and `postFactor` values control how much influence these differences have.
    `postFactor` is chosen larger than `preFactor` such that BST differences in the post-evolution species have a greater influence.
    ```java
   double scaledPre = Math.pow((double) targetPreBST / samplePre, preFactor);
   double scaledPost = Math.pow((double) targetPostBST / samplePost, postFactor);
   ```


4. **Adjust the sample’s evolution level** by multiplying its level with the average of the two scaling factors.

5. **Add the weighted contribution** of this adjusted level to the totals:

    * Add `(adjustedLevel * weight)` to `weightedSum`.
    * Add `weight` to `weightSum`.

---

### Final Computation

After all samples are processed, compute the **estimated evolution level** as the weighted average:

```
estimatedLevel = round(weightedSum / weightSum);
```

---

### Summary

This algorithm performs a **distance-weighted interpolation or extrapolation** using all known level-up evolutions.
It estimates the evolution level of non-level-up evolutions based on how their Base Stat Totals compare to those of known evolutions.

* Evolutions with BST pairs closer to the target have **stronger influence**.
* The post-evolution difference between the sample's and the target's BSTs has a **stronger influence** than the pre-evolution difference between the sample's and the target's BSTs.
